## Mobile Support
- Builds running on iOS/Android now use drag-based touch controls. Press and hold anywhere on screen, then drag to steer the player.
- Movement speed scales with drag distance; releasing clears input.
- In the Unity Editor you can toggle `Enable Mobile Controls In Editor` on the `PlayerController2D` component to simulate touch input with the mouse.
